**FreeLanceDAO Manifesto**
As the digital economy evolves, freelancers stand at the forefront of innovation, creativity, and growth. 

Traditional freelance platforms often impose high fees, centralized control, and opaque practices, limiting the potential of freelancers worldwide. 

We, the members of FreeLanceDAO, envision a decentralized future built on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP), where freelancers and clients interact directly, securely, and transparently. 

Our mission is to create a fair, open, and democratic marketplace that empowers freelancers to thrive and clients to find the best talent globally.

**Our Vision**
